Olympus Mons is an extinct shield volcano, meaning it was formed as a result of a slow and prolonged lava flow. Why is it so tall? Scientists say the reason is the lack of tectonic plates on Mars.

Scientists, observing the deviations in the orbital motion of Uranus, concluded that it must be influenced by another, unknown planet. When it was theoretically known where it should be (Urban Le Verrier predicted it), it was observed by Johann Galle. Neptune was visited by only one Voyager 2 spacecraft that passed near the planet on August 25, 1989.",

In fact, the star may look completely different, or it may not even exist. Of course, this also works the other way around. You can see the earth from many years ago from some places in space.

Neptun jest jedyna planeta, ktorej nie udowodniono obserwacjami na niebie, ale obliczeniami matematycznymi! Naukowcy obserwujac odchylenia w ruchu orbitalnym Urana doszli do wniosku, ze musi na niego wplywac inna, nieznana planeta. Kiedy teoretycznie wiadomo bylo, gdzie powinno byc (przewidywal to Urban Le Verrier), obserwowal je Johann Galle.

Jesli gwiazda znajduje sie 50 lat swietlnych od Ziemi, oznacza to, ze swiatlo potrzebuje 50 lat, aby do nas dotrzec - to znaczy, patrzymy na jej obraz sprzed 50 lat. W rzeczywistosci gwiazda moze wygladac zupelnie inaczej, a moze nawet nie istniec. Oczywiscie dziala to rowniez w druga strone. Z niektorych miejsc w kosmosie mozna zobaczyc Ziemie sprzed wielu lat. Oznacza to, ze bitwe pod Grunwaldem mozna ogladac na zywo z miejsca w kosmosie oddalonego o 612 lat swietlnych od Ziemi."
